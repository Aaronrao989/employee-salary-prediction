# employee-salary-prediction
Machine Learning project to predict employee salaries based on years of experience using Linear Regression.
# Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **salary prediction model** using a simple dataset containing employee experience and salary data. The goal is to predict the salary of an employee given their years of experience.

We use **Linear Regression** from Scikit-learn to create and train the model.
